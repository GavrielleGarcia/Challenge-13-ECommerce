# Challenge-13-ECommerce

## User Story
 ```bash
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Installation
  To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
npm i
npm install dotenv --save
npm install express
npm install sequelize sqlite3
npm install --save mysql2
npm install console.table --save
```

After the dependencies are installed, create a .ENV file and fill it with your connection information. Example as follows:

```bash

DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'
DB_USER='root'
DB_PASSWORD=''

```

Now, you can proceed to create the datbase schema:

```bash
 #under MySQL terminal
    mysql -u root -p
    # to create the DB schema
    db/SOURCE schema.sql
```

Then, start working with the main file:

```bash
 #    node seeds/index.js
```
